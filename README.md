### Generative AI Use Case for Collaboration Operations

**Objective:**  
Implement a **Generative AI** solution to enhance the resolution process for end-user incidents related to collaboration tools such as Teams, Outlook, Power BI, and others. The primary focus is on automating feedback and resolution suggestions based on historical data from previous incidents and resolutions, thereby reducing manual effort and improving user satisfaction.

### **Problem Statement:**
Currently, the operations team manages a high volume of daily incidents related to collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Power BI, etc. Each incident is resolved manually, and the resolution details are provided to the end-user through ServiceNow comments. However, there is no proactive feedback loop to guide users based on previously resolved incidents, which could reduce repetitive incident creation and improve user self-service capabilities.

### **Proposed Solution:**  
Introduce a **Generative AI-powered feedback system** that:
1. **Analyzes historical incident resolutions.**
2. **Suggests resolutions** to users when they log a new incident, based on similar past incidents.
3. Provides **feedback** on the effectiveness of suggested solutions by continuously learning from user interactions.

### **Key Components of the AI System:**

1. **Incident Data Collection & Analysis:**
   - Use ServiceNow’s incident database to gather a historical dataset of all resolved incidents related to collaboration tools.
   - Analyze patterns in common issues and resolutions, such as connection problems in Teams, email synchronization issues in Outlook, or report generation problems in Power BI.
   - Categorize incidents and solutions based on key factors like resolution time, complexity, and user satisfaction.

2. **AI Model Development:**
   - Build a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) model** that can understand incident descriptions and match them with the most relevant historical resolutions.
   - The model should use clustering techniques to group similar incidents and identify common resolution patterns.
   - Train the AI model to provide personalized resolution suggestions based on the specifics of a new incident, including keywords, user profile, and incident history.

3. **Automated Feedback System:**
   - Integrate the Generative AI model with ServiceNow, so that when a new incident is logged, the system can provide a list of suggested resolutions drawn from previous similar incidents.
   - Offer a **feedback loop** where users can rate the suggested solutions, and the system learns from this feedback to improve future recommendations.

4. **User Notification & Resolution Suggestions:**
   - When a user raises a new ticket, the system will automatically suggest solutions based on prior incidents. For example:
     - A user logs an issue related to Teams not syncing; the system will recommend steps such as clearing cache or reconnecting the Teams account, referencing previous resolved tickets.
     - If a solution doesn't resolve the issue, the incident is escalated to a human agent.
   - Users can interact with the AI through a **chat interface** that guides them step-by-step through possible solutions before escalating the issue to the support team.

5. **Continuous Learning & Improvement:**
   - The system should evolve by continuously learning from newly resolved incidents and user feedback.
   - Over time, the AI will improve the accuracy of its recommendations, reducing the number of tickets escalated to human agents.

### **Benefits:**

1. **Improved Resolution Time:**
   - With AI-driven suggestions, users can resolve incidents faster without needing to wait for manual responses from the support team.
   - The team can focus on more complex issues while AI handles repetitive and common incidents.

2. **Higher User Satisfaction:**
   - Users will receive immediate assistance with intelligent suggestions, leading to higher satisfaction and less frustration with common issues.
   - Reduced time spent on manual resolution leads to faster responses and happier end-users.

3. **Reduced Incident Volume:**
   - By suggesting solutions to users before they even submit a ticket, the system can reduce the overall number of tickets raised, alleviating the workload on support teams.

4. **Cost Savings:**
   - Automation of the incident resolution process with AI will lead to reduced labor costs by minimizing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.

5. **Better Decision-Making:**
   - Analytics generated from AI suggestions and user feedback can help operations teams make more informed decisions about tool improvements and common problem areas.

### **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Export and cleanse incident resolution data from ServiceNow.
   - Categorize and tag incidents based on collaboration tool (Teams, Outlook, Power BI, etc.) and problem type.

2. **AI Model Development:**
   - Collaborate with data scientists to develop and train the NLP model.
   - Test the model using a sample dataset of incidents and resolutions.

3. **Integration with ServiceNow:**
   - Integrate the AI model with ServiceNow using APIs for incident creation and response suggestions.
   - Build a feedback system to capture user responses to AI-generated suggestions.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Run pilot tests with select users and monitor the accuracy of the AI’s suggestions.
   - Make adjustments to the model based on pilot feedback and performance metrics.

5. **Launch & Continuous Improvement:**
   - Gradually roll out the AI feedback system to all users, starting with frequent incidents.
   - Continuously collect data from user interactions to improve AI accuracy over time.

---

### **Conclusion:**
By leveraging Generative AI, collaboration operations can automate incident resolution for end-users, reducing ticket volumes, improving user satisfaction, and enabling more efficient operations. This solution can be extended to cover multiple tools and evolve based on continuous learning, providing long-term value for both users and support teams.
